# City Game

I started developing during the constant bombing of Ukraine, living in Kyiv, when everything was plunged into a months-long blackout. In order to distract from stress and terrible thoughts, in a dark cold apartment by the light of a flashlight and candles - I had to come up with a hobby for myself. I could code on a laptop as long as there was energy in its batteries. When the energy ran out, I used a piece of paper and a pen to keep going.
It turned out to be very suitable for the situation.
This game has few cool graphics that require a lot of energy, and most importantly, such a game contains many complex and intricate algorithms. I have not dealt with some algorithms before.
The experience that I want to share is try to write a similar game from scratch, in a programming language that is convenient for you, I guarantee you will find a lot of exciting things to think about.


## God bless you, you will never be under many months of rocket and bomb attacks in your cities and villages.
